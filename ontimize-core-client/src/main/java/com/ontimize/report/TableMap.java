/**
 * In a chain of data manipulators some behavior is common. TableMap provides most of this behavior
 * and can be subclassed by filters that only need to override a handful of specific methods.
 * TableMap implements TableModel by routing all requests to its model, and TableModelListener by
 * routing all events to its listeners. Inserting a TableMap which has not been subclassed into a
 * chain of table filters should have no effect.
